    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>
      Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties,
      composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that
      explores the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>
      The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each
      element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for
      hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classifed into groups and periods
      based on thier properties.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemical Equations</h2>
    <p>
      Chemical reaction are represented using
      <em>chemical equations.</em> Here's an example of a chemical reaction :
    </p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O <sub>2</sub> &#8594 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>
      This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas
      <em>&#40 H<sub>2 </sub>&#41</em> and oxygen gas <em>&#40 O<sub>2 </sub>&#41</em> to form water
      <em>&#40 H<sub>2</sub>O &#41</em>
    </p>

    <h3>Important Concepts</h3>
    <p>
      Stoichiomtry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical
      reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and
      charge are conserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sub>subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a
      molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of
      atoms in an ion.
    </p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
      Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From
      the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our
      bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
